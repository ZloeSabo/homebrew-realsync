# homebrew-realsync
A tap of Mac Homebrew formulas for [dkLab RealSync](https://github.com/DmitryKoterov/dklab_realsync).

## Usage

```bash
$ brew tap ZloeSabo/homebrew-realsync
$ brew install dklab_realsync
```

## Why?

Because official repository does not yet support versioning which is required
by official Homebrew [formula guideline](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Formula-Cookbook.md#basic-instructions).
